# Electron Webmail Wrapper
This electron wrapper has jQuery enabled so you can edit this line with whatever website you want
```sh
mainWindow.loadURL('https://mail.google.com')
```
If the website has notifications enabled they'll work on Windows 8, 8.1, 10, OSX. Not sure if also in Linux.

This repo is ment to be used as example on how to use jQuery and how to build applications with Electron,
here you have the entire package for automated build for Windows (electronBuilder.exe, sources [HERE](https://github.com/dnviti/electron-CS-builder))
